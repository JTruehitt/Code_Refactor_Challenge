# Module 1 Challenge: Landing Page

## Description

This is the first assigned challenge for the UCF Coding Bootcamp. Our task was to take intentionally flawed starter code and refactor it to meet modern accessibility standards. This involed applying semantic html elements, ensuring that the code was in a logical and descriptive format, and cleaning up the css file so that it functioned as expected with as little code as possible.
